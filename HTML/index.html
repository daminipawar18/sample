 <pre> <h2>When things went well, I’d swagger
    The credit all was mine
    But when I had a problem
    I’d blame God every time
    
    But how could I blame Jesus
    For struggle or for strife
    When I had never asked Him
    To please control my life
    
    I had no right to blame Him
    I gave Him no control
    To do just what I wanted
    Was pretty much my goal
    
    Ignoring the Creator
    Seemed dreadfully unfair
    If when I had a problem </h2></pre>
